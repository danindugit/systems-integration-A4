# Molecule Viewer

Molecule Viewer is a web application developed for the **Software Systems Development and Integration** course, also known ominously as **"Angel of Death"** (Course Code: **CIS*2750**).

This application allows users to manage a database of molecules, providing functionality to:

- **Edit and manage molecules** within the system
- **Upload `.sdf` files** to import molecular data
- **View molecules in 3D** via a dynamically generated **SVG** display

## 🚀 Live Frontend

You can access and interact with the frontend of the Molecule Viewer here:

## Features

- 🔬 **3D SVG Viewer**: Visualize molecular structures in an interactive SVG format
- 📂 **.sdf File Support**: Upload and parse `.sdf` files to add new molecules
- 🛠️ **Database Management**: Add, edit, and remove molecules through the interface
- 💾 **Persistent Storage**: All molecule data is stored and managed through an integrated backend system

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **SVG Rendering**: Custom logic for 3D rendering of molecules
- **Backend**: C-based backend integration (handled as part of course infrastructure)
- **File Parsing**: `.sdf` file handling for molecule import
